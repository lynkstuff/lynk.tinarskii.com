  desc: `I'm a student in 8th grade at Assumption Samutprakarn School. I love learning and teaching others. I enjoy math and science, but also love to code. I've been programming since I was 12 years old, and have been developing websites since then. I started contributing to open-source communities and have made some of the most popular sites on the web such as Wrong-Lang. My goal is to make programming accessible to everyone â€” not just those who are already good at it!`,
